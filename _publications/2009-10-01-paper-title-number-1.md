This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates machine learning with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to enhance empirical significance and coverage. By leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify optimal configurations, the method overcomes traditional limitations in QCA related to limited diversity and case selection. The integration allows for more robust set-theoretic analysis in both small-N and large-N research contexts.
