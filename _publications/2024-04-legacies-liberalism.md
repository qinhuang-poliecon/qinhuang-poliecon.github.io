This paper explores how the political agency of provincial leaders during the early reform period in China (1978-1992) shaped the development of more liberal economic institutions in certain regions. Drawing on archival research, interviews with former officials, and quantitative analysis, I trace how the decisions of reform-minded provincial leaders established institutional foundations that continue to influence regional economic development today.

The study highlights how individual political actors exercised agency within the constraints of China's authoritarian system, identifying key mechanisms through which early liberal reforms became self-reinforcing over time. I analyze how initial differences in market liberalization efforts, property rights protections, and foreign investment policies created divergent paths of institutional development across Chinese provinces.
