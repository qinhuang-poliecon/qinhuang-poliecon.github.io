This paper, co-authored with James Mahoney, develops a comprehensive conceptual framework for analyzing radical political transformations throughout world history. We examine patterns of revolutionary change, identifying key mechanisms that drive large-scale institutional transformations across different historical and geographical contexts.

The study analyzes multiple cases of radical political change, synthesizing insights from historical sociology, comparative politics, and historical institutionalism. We propose a typology of transformation patterns and explore the causal mechanisms that lead to different trajectories of institutional development following periods of radical change.
