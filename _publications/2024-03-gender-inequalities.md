This paper introduces a novel methodological approach that combines large-N Qualitative Comparative Analysis with machine learning techniques to identify multiple causal pathways that lead to gender inequalities in political participation across different contexts. 

The study identifies several distinct causal configurations of social, economic, and institutional factors that systematically produce gender disparities in political representation and participation. By employing a set-theoretic approach, I demonstrate how different combinations of conditions interact to create barriers to women's political engagement, revealing complex patterns that traditional statistical methods might overlook.

The methodological framework presented offers a powerful tool for analyzing complex social phenomena where multiple causal pathways may lead to similar outcomes, while still accommodating large datasets.
