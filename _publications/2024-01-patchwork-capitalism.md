This paper examines the divergent economic trajectories of China's regions over four decades of Reform and Opening. Through machine-learning analysis, I identify four distinct types of regional economies—quasi-liberal, dual-market, state-retreating, and state-dominating—each shaped by varying degrees of market development and state influence. 

Based on extensive fieldwork across 14 Chinese provinces, I find that policy choices made by provincial leaders in the 1980s were decisive, setting in motion path-dependent economic trajectories that have persisted and been reinforced over time. My research highlights the importance of the early autonomy granted by Deng Xiaoping, which enabled local officials to pursue tailored development strategies—the effects of which continue to shape regional economies today.
