This paper examines the various pathways to digital governance implementation across Chinese provinces, highlighting the role of fiscal resources and political pressure in explaining regional disparities. Using a configurational analysis approach, we identify multiple causal pathways that lead to successful digital governance implementation. The study demonstrates how different combinations of fiscal capacity, political incentives, and institutional factors produce varying outcomes across China's provinces.
