Presentation of my job market paper at the Chinese Politics Mini-Conference at the American Political Science Association Annual Meeting. This paper examines the divergent economic trajectories of China's regions over four decades of Reform and Opening.

The presentation discussed:

* The development of four distinct types of regional economies in China: quasi-liberal, dual-market, state-retreating, and state-dominating
* How these regional economies were shaped by varying degrees of market development and state influence
* Evidence from machine learning analysis and extensive fieldwork in 14 Chinese provinces
* The critical role of policy choices made by provincial leaders in the 1980s in setting path-dependent economic trajectories
* How Deng Xiaoping's policy of early autonomy enabled local officials to pursue tailored development strategies
* The persistence and reinforcement of these regional economic patterns over four decades

The paper contributes to broader theoretical discussions about varieties of capitalism, institutional change, and the political economy of development in authoritarian contexts.
