An invited lecture at Peking University discussing the theoretical foundations and practical applications of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in social science research. The talk introduced set-theoretic methods, configurational thinking, and demonstrated applications from my research on subnational political economy in China.

The presentation covered:

* Theoretical foundations of set-theoretic methods
* Differences between QCA and regression-based approaches
* Appropriate research questions for configurational analysis
* Step-by-step implementation of QCA in empirical research
* Recent methodological innovations, including machine learning enhancements
* Practical applications in comparative politics and political economy

The lecture included both theoretical discussions and practical demonstrations using R software, with emphasis on the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance traditional QCA approaches.
